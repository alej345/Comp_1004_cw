A basic password manager that runs entirely in your browser. It lets you save, view, and delete passwords using local storage.

## What It Does

- All data is stored safely in your browser

## How It Works

- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
2. Fill in the form with your login details
3. Click Save to store your password
4. View or delete saved passwords below the form

## Notes
